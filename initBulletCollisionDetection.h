/** \mainpage BulletCollisionDetection - a plugin using Bullet collision pipeline within Sofa
 * This plugin contains the Bullet collision pipeline itself named BulletCollisionDetection, where
 * broad phase and narrow phase are performed. So in the Sofa scene, you must place the element
 * BulletCollisionDetection instead of any broad or narrow phase. An important thing to know is
 * that this plugin works well with constraints (LMConstraintSolver for example) and no with penlity contacts because
 * it is not robust to collision models penetration.
 *
 *
 * It contains also the element BulletIntersection which must replace any kind of Sofa intersection
 * method. So it has also to be placed in the Sofa scene.
 *
 * It contains models already existing in Sofa and inheriting from them :
 * - BulletTriangleModel
 * - BulletSphereModel
 * - BulletCapsuleModel BulletRigidCapsuleModel
 * - BulletOBBModel
 * - BulletCylinderModel
 * There are also a collision model that don't derive from any of the Sofa collision models :
 * - BulletConvexHullModel
 * Note that BulletConvexHullModel is special because its parametirization can completely change its behaviour :
 * - it contains the parameter called computeConvexHullDecomposition, if set to true, the convex hull is decomposed in convex parts
 * - the parameter concavityThreeshold is a real that parameterizes the convex hull decomposition, the more this parameter will be high, the more the decomposition will be gross
 * - you can visualize the decomposition by setting the parameter drawConvexHullDecomposition to true
 * - another important thing is that its loading is similar to a triangle model because it needs a mesh but it is templated by a rigid mechanical object which position and orientation define also the position and orientation of the BulletConvexHull if positionDefined is set to true and if it is not, the mechanical must be of size 0 and its position/orientation will be computed at runtime as the barycenter of the entry points
 *
 * All collision models have the field called margin. It enlarges the primitives (only in bullet, not in sofa) using the value of margin.
 * For a box, its extents are enlarged, for a sphere or a capsule, their radius are enlarged.
 * Only the BulletConvexHullModel and the BulletTriangleModel use a real margin, meaning that the primitives are not enlarged, and
 * the collision closer than the value margin are detected.
 *
 * You can find some examples in the folder examples:
 * - BulletConvexHullDemo.scn which decomposes two objects show the decomposition:
 * \image html BulletConvexHullDemo.png
 * - GlobalBulletCollision.scn is an example of all primitives falling into a salad bowl, it is using sofa python :
 * \image html GlobalBulletCollision.png
 * - BulletSphere.scn is a very simple scene :
 * \image html BulletSphere.png
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - You must have bullet 2.82 installed and specify its location in the CMakeCache.txt by filling the paths BULLET_INCLUDE_PATH (for bullet include files) and BULLET_LIB_PATH (for bullet binary files)
 * - HACD (a part of bullet for convex hull decomposition) must also be installed at the same locations than bullet
 *
 * Issues:
 * - Currently, the plugin doesn't work well with CompliantContacts
 * - Some improvements to static meshes could be done by using another Bullet mesh class in this case
